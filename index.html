                Well well well, Looks like it works. Now being served by browser-sync. <br>
                Remember here's how you launch Browser-sync from the terminal: <br>
                $ browser-sync start --server --d --f "**/*"<br>
                To install browser-sync from npm use: <br>
                $npm install -g browser-sync <br>
                (-g installs for all users) <br>
                You might also have to install gyp (some python thing) $npm install -g node-gyp
